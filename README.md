Secret Messages

Development of an HTML application to Encode/ decode a text message:


My pet project which I love to call as Secret Messages, I created an html page using JSP (Java Servlet Pages) which communicates with a Java program to encode or decode the messages entered by the user depending upon an integer key, also chosen by the user. 

So if you enter your message to be encrypted/ encoded in the input message box and also give a key which could be a number between -26 and 26, you can get the encoded message by clicking submit.

This project is under progress and more modifications are expected.

The project was tested running on the local Tom cat Server. The screenshots of the project is also included in the repo.
